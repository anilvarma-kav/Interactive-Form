# Interactive-Form
 In This project I am creating an Interactive Registration form for a fictional Conference called "FullStack Conf" using HTML, CSS , 
 JavaScript and jQuery Library to make the form more user-friendly by:
 1. Adding customized and conditional behavior and interactivity
 2. Validating user input and providing helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields. (by using regular expressions)
 
 In this project instead of plain JavaScript I will be using jQuery library. I am using jQuery because of three reasons:
 1.  Shorter and simplified syntax
 2.  Help with cross-browser compatibility since jQuery deals with a lot of that stuff under the hood
 3. A strong familiarity with jQuery will only make you a better developer since it enjoys a strong market share on the web
